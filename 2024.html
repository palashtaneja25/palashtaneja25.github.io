        <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Hey Eunsoo,</h1>
        <p class="mb-4">Sorry I couldn't give you a card in-person. But I hope this is the next best thing. I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you. That letter you wrote last week meant the world
            to me. Your love shines through every word you write, and it's something I deeply appreciate.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">When I'm sick, you're always there, taking care of me without a second thought. It means
            everything to have someone as caring as you by my side. I had fun having Covid with you <3</p>

        <p class="mb-4">We've been through a lot of changes together, and I'm grateful for how we adapt and adjust as a
            team. It's not always easy, but facing things together makes it all manageable.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">The way we love each other, no matter what, is something special. It's what keeps us strong, no
            matter what life throws our way. I know that no matter what 2024 looks like I want it to be with you. I want to get better at the things where I've been messing up and making things hard for you, and I hope you'll see a difference in how I support you going forward.</p>

	<p class="mb-4">Until then, I hope you don't forget about me in Korea. </p>


        <p class="text-gray-700">Love always,</p>
        <p class="font-bold">감자</p>
